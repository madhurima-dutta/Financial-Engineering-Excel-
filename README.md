# Markowitz Portfolio Optimization and CAPM (MS Excel Project)

## Goal
To optimize an investment portfolio by applying the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Markowitz Portfolio Theory using Excel formulas , Solver add-in and data analysis tools. The objective is to balance risk and expected return based on historical stock data.

## Overview
This project utilizes Excel to apply Markowitz Portfolio Theory and CAPM for constructing an optimized portfolio. The analysis includes calculating portfolio variance, returns, and risks using Excel formulas. Pivot tables  and scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between risk and return. Through Excel-based regression analysis, beta values are estimated, and expected returns are predicted. Various Excel features like line charts help in illustrating efficient portfolios, aiding in better investment decisions by offering a clear representation of the trade-offs between risk and return.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates how Excel can be effectively used to apply CAPM and Markowitz Portfolio Theory, resulting in optimized portfolios with minimized risk and desired returns. The use of formulas, pivot tables, and charts in Excel provided a hands-on and practical approach to portfolio optimization.
